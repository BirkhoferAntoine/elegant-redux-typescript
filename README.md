# Elegant Redux - React TypeScript Redux Practice Project

Elegant Redux is a simple, single-page application (SPA) designed as an e-shop for clothing. It serves as a practice project for students learning to build applications using React, TypeScript, and Redux. The project focuses on showcasing how to manage state in a React app with Redux, allowing users to add clothes to their shopping cart in a straightforward and intuitive interface.

## About The Project

Elegant Redux is crafted to help students understand the core concepts of building modern web applications with React, TypeScript, and Redux. It's a mock e-shop application where users can explore a catalog of clothes, add them to their cart, and manage their selections. While simple, this application covers key aspects of SPA development, including state management, component-based architecture, and typesafe design patterns.

This project is intended purely for educational purposes, providing a hands-on way for students to engage with the technologies and concepts that are shaping the future of web development.
